 - Re-install Google Chrome to current version
 - Re-install GIT now version 2.47.0
 - Re-configured GIT
 - Deleted and created new SSH key, tested successfully
 - Created odin-recipes repository on GitHub account
 - Initialized GIT in the home/kahlshira/repos folder (now contains the .git hidden folder)
 - Cloned new odin-recipes to local directory home/kahlshira/repos/odin-recipes

 Now ready to continue Project:Recipes -> Assignment section
