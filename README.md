* UPDATE 11/13/24
Completed the Assigment, created the pages, added them to staging, committed to git with message.  Now waiting for the process to finish and become avaialble for viewing.  The local view and links work correctly.

Ready to continue on once I verify the upload to GIT is complete.

* UPDATE 11/12/2024
To get to this point I needed to re-cover all of the initial configuration steps.
 - Update the Linux Ubuntu OS
 - Re-install Google Chrome to current version
 - Re-install GIT now version 2.47.0
 - Re-configured GIT
 - Deleted and created new SSH key, tested successfully
 - Created odin-recipes repository on GitHub account
 - Initialized GIT in the home/kahlshira/repos folder (now contains the .git hidden folder)
 - Cloned new odin-recipes to local directory home/kahlshira/repos/odin-recipes

 Now ready to continue Project:Recipes -> Assignment section
